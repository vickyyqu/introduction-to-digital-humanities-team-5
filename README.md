# Introduction to Digital Humanities and Social Analytics Team 5: 18th Century French Novel Analysis

The project proposal is max 800 words. The project description must contain a research question (RQ), a thesis statement, a description of the dataset, an action plan, and a team chart:

The relevance of the RQ should be based on a minimum of 3 articles/books on the topic;
The thesis statement is the solution/answer to the RQ that you want to investigate;
The dataset you will use to answer/investigate your RQ should be problematized (e.g., what are the advantages and limitations of the dataset?);

A short description of how you think you need to process, model, and expand the data based on your RQ (use the data scope steps and/or Template_Dataset_evaluation.docx Download Template_Dataset_evaluation.docxfollowing the checklist);
Clear references to the literature you used in an official academic style;
Think of the the team charter as your team's log. It should describe the team members (i.e., composition, backgrounds, academic disciplines, etc.), clearly state deliverables and deadlines, foreseen and actual challenges and opportunities, potential pitfalls, means of collaborations and communications, frequency of meetings, division in work packages, timeline, and so on.

### How to come up with a good research question (fyi)
With more and more teens using smartphones and social media,
cyber bullying is on the rise. Cyber bullying puts a lot of stress on
many teens, and can cause depression, anxiety, and even suicidal
thoughts. Parents should limit the usage of smart phones, monitor
their children's online activity, and report any cyber bullying to
school officials in order to combat this problem.
This is a good thesis statement. It states a clear position to a clearly defined problem. The thesis statement offers a solution to
the problem. It still needs to explain and define key terms, such as ‘cyber bullying’ but it’s a solid thesis statement because it
has all the key components of a research paper.

• Be Specific rather than general
• Measurable: You must find some way of measuring your outcome
• Attainable: You must be capable of attaining your goal. Where the prospect of
achievement seems daunting, consider adjusting the plan
• Realistic: Think big, but start small. The action needs to be significant and relevant
to the problem that you are trying to solve
• Timely: You should be able to answer the question why now?
