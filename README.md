## Research Question
How did the sentiments of French novel descriptions evolve over the 18th century, and how did they differ according to the gender of the authors?
<br>
## Thesis Statement
We argue that the sentiments portrayed in the descriptions of 18th-century French novels shift significantly over time, with noticeable differences between male and female authors. These differences reflect the distinct societal roles and constraints females experienced, showing a gendered dimension in literary expression. A change in literary sentiment over time has been seen in 20th-century literature reflecting historical developments (Acerbi et al., 2013), and thus our team is interested to discover if the same can be observed in French novels over the 18th century.
<br>
Marlene LeGates displays a clear difference in how women and men write about womanhood with men being more traditional and women more progressive at the beginning of the 18th century (1976) which leads us to explore gender-based differences across various topics. 
<br>
Our project will be analyzing plot summaries instead of the entire corpus, which according to Simone Rebora (2018), should yield similar sentiment results. This reduces the data volume and will speed up the analysis.
<br>
This research is timely and increasingly relevant today as new digital tools allow us to analyze and perform complex tasks on large amounts of data. With an increasing interest in gender representation, this paves the way for a more inclusive understanding of the past.

## Dataset Description
The dataset published by the Trier Center for Digital Humanities (TCDH) at Trier University contains 200 digital texts of 18th-century French novels created or first published between 1751 and 1800. The two years with the most published books in this dataset are 1798, with 10 books, and 1800 with 11 books. The dataset consists of 35 female, 163 male, and 6 uncategorized authors. 
<br>
### Advantages
Though it is a relatively small dataset of just 200 novels, the dataset was built and refined using OCR technology and additional metadata to create a more balanced and representative set of texts from the late 18th century, factoring in the gender, year of first publication and narrative form of each text.
The underrepresentation of female authors in 18th-century French literature provides an opportunity to bring attention to a frequently overlooked part of literary history and to observe the metadata differences across the genders.
<br>
### Challenges
18th-century French differs from modern French in grammar, spelling, and vocabulary, complicating the application of modern text-processing methods. Additionally, the selection of texts may be skewed by what has survived and does not accurately represent the true population.
<br>
Another challenge is that our dataset is imbalanced in terms of gender, the statistical significance of any findings related to their sentiment may be weaker compared to those of male authors. Another important aspect to consider is the fact that the different societal constraints on female authors in the 18th century could have a significant influence on both their writing style and the topics they chose to address, which may influence our findings.

## Action Plan
<ol>
<li>Collection of additional data: retrieving the novel descriptions we will do this either through a summarization module (e.g. CamemBERT, FlauBERT) or public access summaries of the text</li>
<li>Preprocess Data: Ensure novel descriptions are cleaned (remove punctuation, normalize spelling).</li>
<li>Sentiment Analysis: Apply a sentiment analysis tool (e.g., TextBlob, Vader) tailored for French, or train a model if needed.</li>
<li>Temporal and Gender Analysis: Analyze sentiment trends across decades and across genders.</li>
<li>Visualize: Use line graphs for sentiment evolution over time and bar charts for gender differences.</li>
<li>Interpret: Contextualize trends with historical events or gender norms of the period.</li>
</ol>
