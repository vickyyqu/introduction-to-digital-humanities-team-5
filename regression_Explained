Explaining the model:

Multireg_Ref_1:
  refrencelevel = 1 (male)
  1. Neutral Sentiment (Category 1) vs. Negative Sentiment (Category 0)
    Unidentified and Female authors are both less likely than Male authors to produce neutral sentiment texts compared to negative.
    Unidentified authors show a slightly stronger negative effect compared to Female authors when compared to Male authors.
  2. Positive Sentiment (Category 2) vs. Negative Sentiment (Category 0)
    Unidentified authors are slightly less likely than Male authors to produce positive sentiment texts compared to negative.
    Female authors, however, are more likely to produce positive sentiment texts compared to Male authors.
  In both cases (neutral vs. negative and positive vs. negative), the year has a positive effect. This means that as time progresses, texts are more 
  likely to have neutral or positive sentiment compared to negative sentiment.
